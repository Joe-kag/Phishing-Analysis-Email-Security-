### 4. **Attachment Analysis**
- **Case 1**: Regional Sales Manager received suspicious Chrome toolbar installation request
  - Extracted and analyzed compressed .zip files containing SalesBookmarks.exe
  - Performed static analysis to identify malicious executable properties
  
- **Case 2**: HR Specialist compromised by infrastructure upgrade document
  - Investigated ransomware delivery via disguised .7z attachment
  - Identified RTLO character spoofing in filename (appearing as PDF but actually .exe)
